# Security Improvements

The following changes have been made to improve security and remove hard-coded API keys:

## API Keys Removed

1. Removed hard-coded OpenAI API key from:
   - `config/llm_settings.json`
   - `config/settings.py`
   - `config/log_agent_settings.json`

2. Removed other sensitive information:
   - Anthropic API key placeholders
   - MongoDB connection strings with credentials
   - Project IDs

## Environment Variables

1. Updated code to prioritize environment variables for sensitive data:
   - Enhanced the `llm_provider.py` to use environment variables first
   - Updated visualization tools to read from environment
   - Created `.env.example` template

## Documentation

1. Updated README.md with:
   - Instructions for setting up environment variables
   - Security best practices

## Best Practices Implemented

1. Never hard-code API keys or credentials in source code
2. Use environment variables for sensitive information
3. Include example configuration files without real credentials
4. Make code robust to handle missing credentials gracefully
5. Provide clear error messages when credentials are not available

## What to Review Next

1. Check `tests/` directory for any hard-coded credentials in test files
2. Review any Jupyter notebooks or documentation for exposed keys
3. Consider implementing a proper secrets management solution for production
4. Add validation to prevent committing sensitive information
