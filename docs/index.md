# Agentic System

Welcome to the Agentic System documentation â€“ your comprehensive guide to our multi-agent framework for energy sector analysis, calculations, and reporting.

## Overview

The Agentic System is a powerful framework built with AutoGen and modern AI techniques to solve complex problems in the energy sector. It orchestrates multiple specialized agents to handle tasks including:

- Energy calculations (LCOE, capacity factors, NPV)
- Data retrieval and processing
- Formula resolution and validation
- Quality control and reporting

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents working together to solve complex problems
- **Flexible Data Integration**: Connect to databases, APIs, and local files
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and auditing of results
